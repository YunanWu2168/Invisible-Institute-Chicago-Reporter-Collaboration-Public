**Theme**

Recently, incidences of police abuse of authority led to several breaking news, and many
movements against police misconduct took place around the country. In most of the well-known
cases, the victims of police power abuse are underrepresented minorities, while the police officers
involved are white males. However, more detailed analyses on the officers’ and victims’
demographics are necessary to draw statistically significant correlations that can guide actionable
policy changes to reduce or prevent future police misconduct. Citizens Police Data Project
provides a data set of police complaint reports that can represent the overall population rather
than the individual cases from the news. In this project, with the help of this data set and various
data science tools, we would like to study how the demographics comparison between the
complainants and the respective police officers they reported correlate to the number of
complaints. With such a relationship, we can predict a police officer’s likelihood to be reported for
misconduct given the police-citizen demographic pairing

**[Checkpoint-1: Relational Analytics Questions:](https://github.com/YunanWu2168/Invisible-Institute-Chicago-Reporter-Collaboration-Public/tree/master/The%20Powerful%20Turtles/checkpoint-1)**

1. What is the race distribution among the officers? 

2. What is the majority race in the community of which the officer with most complaints? 

3. What is the race distribution among the complainant? 

4. What percentage of officers have the same race with the majority race of their responsible community? 

5. What percentage of officers have the same race with the filer of their complaints? 

6. What percentage of filers of complaints have the same race with the majority race of their community? 

Needs to be added on.
