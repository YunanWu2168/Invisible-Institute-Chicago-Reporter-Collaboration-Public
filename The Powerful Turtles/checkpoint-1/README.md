**Theme**

To see if the officers are representative of the people they serve in each community and if the complaint makeup changes based on officer-demographic-community pairings

**Relational Analytics Questions:**

1. What is the race distribution among the officers? 

2. What is the majority race in the community of which the officer with most complaints? 

3. What is the race distribution among the complainant? 

4. What percentage of officers have the same race with the majority race of their responsible community? 

5. What percentage of officers have the same race with the filer of their complaints? 

6. What percentage of filers of complaints have the same race with the majority race of their community?
